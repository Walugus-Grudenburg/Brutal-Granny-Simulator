# Brutal Granny Simulator
A mod for Granny Simulator to increase its difficulty. 
Install by going to Granny Simulator/Granny Simulator_Data/Managed and replacing the Assembly-CSharp.dll.

Sometimes the mod crashes while loading a level. This is normal, and won't likely be fixed. Try again a few times. If it still fails, then it isn't working.
